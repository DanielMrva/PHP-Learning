                Currently, I have fairly limited experience in PHP, that is, I only started studying it when I first applied to this position with MOPS.
                <br>
                However, in my course of study I've found the logic and syntax of PHP to be relatively easy to understand, and am looking forward to learning more.

                In terms of non-PHP experience, I completed a 6-month full-stack web devlopment bootcamp in June through Denver University.  The course went through web development from front-end to back-end; HTML, CSS, JavaScript, then through to various JavaScript frameworks and libraries such as NodeJS, jQuery, Express, React, and both SQL and No-SQL databases. We also worked with CSS libarries, such as Materialze and Bootstrap.
